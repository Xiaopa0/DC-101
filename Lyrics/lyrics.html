            I recall, when you said that you would never leave me<br>
            You told me more<br>
            So much more like when the time you whispered<br>
            In my ear, there was heaven in my heart<br>
            I remember when you said that you'd be here forever<br>
            <br>
            Then you left without even saying that you're leaving<br>
            I was hurt, and it really won't be easy to forget<br>
            Yesterday, and I pray that you would stay<br>
            But then you're gone and, oh, so far away<br>
            <br>
            I was afraid this time would come,<br>
            I wasn't prepared to face<br>
            This kind of hurtin' from within<br>
            I have learned to live my life beside you<br>
            Maybe I'll just dream of you tonight<br>
            And if into my dream you come<br>
            And touch me once again<br>
            I'll just keep on dreaming<br>
            'Til my heartaches end<br>
            <br>
            And then you left without even saying that you're leaving<br>
            I was hurt, and it really won't be easy to forget<br>
            Yesterday, and I pray that you would stay<br>
            But then you're gone and, oh, so far away<br>
            <br>
            I was afraid this time would come<br>
            I wasn't prepared to face<br>
            This kind of hurtin' from within<br>
            I have learned to live my life beside you<br>
            Maybe I'll just dream of you tonight<br>
            And if into my dream you come<br>
            And touch me once again<br>
            I'll just keep on dreaming<br>
            'Til my heartaches end<br>
            <br>
            I was afraid this time would come<br>
            I wasn't prepared to face<br>
            This kind of hurtin' from within<br>
            I have learned to live my life beside you<br>
            Maybe I'll just dream of you tonight<br>
            And if into my dream you come<br>
            And touch me once again<br>
            I'll just keep on dreaming<br>
            'Til my heartaches end<br>
            <br>
            Keep on dreaming<br>
            'Til my heartaches end<br>
